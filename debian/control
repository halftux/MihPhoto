Description: MihPhoto is meant to be a simple touchscreen-friendly image viewer.
  There a lot of very good image viewers, including many opensource ones, but most of them are very difficult to handle on a touchscreen. 
  This application was designed with touchscreens in mind so it is most useful if you have a touchscreen. 
  To use the application just open an image; then you can use the a swipe gesture to browse trough all the images located in the same folder as the first one.
